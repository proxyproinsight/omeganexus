# üöÄ Omega9-NEXUS v20.0 - Smart Source Management

## Overview
Implemented intelligent source timeout handling with exponential backoff to prevent dead sources from slowing down the hunt.

## New Features

### 1. ‚è±Ô∏è Smart Timeout System
**15-Second Per-Source Timeout**
- Each source has a hard 15-second timeout limit
- If a source doesn't respond within 15s, it's skipped immediately
- No more waiting minutes for dead sources!

### 2. üìä Exponential Backoff Algorithm
**Formula**: `retry_delay = 5 minutes √ó 2^(failures)` (max 24 hours)

| Failure Count | Retry Delay | Next Retry After |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1st failure  | 5 minutes   | 5 min           |
| 2nd failure  | 10 minutes  | 15 min total    |
| 3rd failure  | 20 minutes  | 35 min total    |
| 4th failure  | 40 minutes  | 1h 15min total  |
| 5th failure  | 80 minutes  | 2h 35min total  |
| 6th failure  | 160 minutes | 5h 15min total  |
| 7th failure  | 320 minutes | 10h 35min total |
| 8+ failures  | 24 hours    | Daily retry     |

**Auto-Disable**: After 10 consecutive failures, source is deactivated

### 3. üîÑ Priority-Based Source Selection
Sources are now selected in this order:
1. **Working sources** (0 failures) - highest priority
2. **Recently recovered** sources - medium priority  
3. **Sources ready for retry** (past cooldown) - lower priority
4. **Never tried** sources - exploration mode

**Skips**:
- Sources currently in cooldown period
- Sources with 10+ consecutive failures

### 4. üìà 89 Fresh 2025 Sources Added

**Breakdown by Category**:
- **GitHub Raw Lists**: 45+ sources (TheSpeedX, Proxifly, Vakhov, etc.)
- **API Endpoints**: 8 sources (ProxyScrape, OpenProxyList, etc.)
- **Web Scrapers**: 15+ sources (FreeProxyList, SSLProxies, etc.)

**Fresh 2025 Additions**:
- `getfreeproxy/daily-proxy-list` (Live updates)
- `vakhov/fresh-proxy-list` (Oct 2025 fresh)
- `proxifly/free-proxy-list` (Auto-updates)
- Enhanced APIs with better filters

## How It Works

### Hunt Cycle Flow
```
1. Query database for sources ready to try
   ‚Üì
2. For each source (max 40 per cycle):
   - Set 15s timeout
   - Try to fetch proxies
   ‚Üì
3a. SUCCESS ‚Üí Reset failure count, continue
3b. TIMEOUT ‚Üí Increment failures, calculate backoff, schedule retry
   ‚Üì
4. Move to next source immediately (no blocking!)
   ‚Üì
5. Repeat every 5 minutes
```

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New columns for smart retry
ALTER TABLE sources ADD COLUMN consecutive_failures INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE sources ADD COLUMN last_failure_time INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE sources ADD COLUMN next_retry_time INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Query for ready sources
SELECT * FROM sources 
WHERE active = 1 
AND (consecutive_failures < 10)           -- Not permanently failed
AND (next_retry_time IS NULL              -- Never tried
     OR next_retry_time <= current_time)  -- Ready for retry
ORDER BY consecutive_failures ASC,        -- Working sources first
         quality_score DESC                -- Best quality next
LIMIT 40;
```

## Performance Impact

### Before (v19.0)
- **Dead source delay**: 30-120 seconds per dead source
- **Hunt cycle time**: Up to 60 minutes with many dead sources
- **Wasted bandwidth**: Retrying failed sources every cycle
- **Log spam**: Repeated failures every 5 minutes

### After (v20.0)  
- **Dead source delay**: 15 seconds max (then skip!)
- **Hunt cycle time**: ~10-20 minutes (only active sources)
- **Smart retries**: Exponential backoff prevents spam
- **Clean logs**: Clear retry schedules shown

**Example**:
```
‚úÖ Fetched 247 proxies from Proxifly HTTP in 3.2s
‚è±Ô∏è Timeout fetching from DeadSource123 (15s limit exceeded)
üîÅ Will retry DeadSource123 after 5 minutes (failure #1/10)
‚úÖ Fetched 189 proxies from TheSpeedX SOCKS5 in 4.1s
```

## Monitoring

### Check Source Health
```bash
# View sources in cooldown
sqlite3 omega9.db "
SELECT name, 
       consecutive_failures,
       datetime(next_retry_time, 'unixepoch') as retry_at
FROM sources 
WHERE next_retry_time > strftime('%s', 'now')
ORDER BY next_retry_time;
"

# View permanently failed sources
sqlite3 omega9.db "
SELECT name, consecutive_failures, last_failure_time
FROM sources 
WHERE consecutive_failures >= 10;
"

# Count working vs failing sources
sqlite3 omega9.db "
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN consecutive_failures = 0 OR consecutive_failures IS NULL THEN 'Working'
    WHEN consecutive_failures < 5 THEN 'Degraded'
    WHEN consecutive_failures < 10 THEN 'Failing'
    ELSE 'Dead'
  END as status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM sources
WHERE active = 1
GROUP BY status;
"
```

### Reset a Source
```bash
# Give a source another chance
sqlite3 omega9.db "
UPDATE sources 
SET consecutive_failures = 0, 
    next_retry_time = NULL 
WHERE name = 'SourceName';
"
```

## API Integration

The smart timeout system is transparent - existing APIs work the same:

```bash
# Trigger hunt (uses smart timeout automatically)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/hunt

# Check via Telegram
/hunt - Smart hunt with timeout handling
/sources - View source status (shows failures)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Adjust hunt interval (default: 300s = 5 min)
export HUNT_INTERVAL_SECS=600

# Sources will be auto-skipped if slow
# No configuration needed - it's automatic!
```
